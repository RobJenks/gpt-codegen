You are designing a business process model following the BPMN 2.0 standard.  We will generate the model in two stages
1. Build a HIGH-LEVEL model by connecting together appropriate BPMN 2.0 elements
2. Build a DETAIL-LEVEL model by fleshing out this model and configuring each of the elements

Let us start with the HIGH-LEVEL model.  You can use any of the BPMN 2.0 elements in this component library:
```
${COMPONENT_LIBRARY}
```

You should generate a simplified graph model by returning JSON that complies with the following schema.  You should NOT return a response in JSON Schema format.  Rather you should return raw JSON, which COMPLIES WITH this schema:
```
${SCHEMA_CONTENT}
```

Other requirements:
* You can only use elements specified in the component library above
* A node can only have ONE outbound connection, UNLESS it is an 'exclusiveGateway' node.  As a result, you should use exclusiveGateway nodes to handling branching. They should be placed after a result is calculated which you want to branch on
* Your process should begin with a Start Event and end with one or more End Events

<#if highLevelModel??>
You have previously generated the following model, which follows the schema above:
```
${highLevelModel}
```
You should make the following updates to this model, and return the new full model as JSON (complying to the schema above):
```
${request}
```
<#else>
The model which you should generate in JSON form (complying to the given schema) is as follows:
```
${request}
```
</#if>
Return ONLY the JSON process data, with no other explanation or commentary.
