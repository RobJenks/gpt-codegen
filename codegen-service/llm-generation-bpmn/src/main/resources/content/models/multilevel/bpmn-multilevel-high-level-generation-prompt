You are designing a business process model following the BPMN 2.0 standard.  We will generate the model in two stages
1. Build a HIGH-LEVEL model by connecting together appropriate BPMN 2.0 elements
2. Extend this into a DETAILED model by adding configuration and linking node inputs & outputs

Let us start with the HIGH-LEVEL model.  You can use any of the BPMN 2.0 elements in this component library:
```
${COMPONENT_LIBRARY}
```

You should generate a simplified graph model by returning JSON that complies with the following schema.  You should NOT return a response in JSON Schema format.  Rather you should return raw JSON, which COMPLIES WITH this schema:
```
${SCHEMA_CONTENT}
```

Other requirements:
* You can only use elements specified in the component library above
* A node can only have ONE inbound and ONE outbound connection, UNLESS it is an 'exclusiveGateway' node.  As a result, you should use exclusiveGateway nodes to handling branching. They should be placed after a result is calculated which you want to branch on. If you need to merge branches, use another 'exclusiveGateway' node with no conditions.
* Your process should begin with a Start Event and end with one or more End Events
Each non-endEvent can make outbound connections to other nodes. These connections should reference the 'name' of the node they are connecting to.
  ** The component library specifies which connections are required for each node type. endEvent nodes should have no outbound connections.
  ** If a non-endEvent node has an outbound connection to an endEvent node, ensure that the endEvent node has a unique name and id.
* All steps are part of the SAME process.  You should make sure that steps in your model are correctly linked together to form a single process.  There should be no orphaned steps or processes - every step must be linked.
* Nodes should indicate how each of its inputs will be satisfied. Each input to a node can be one of the following:
  1. A constant value or simple expression.  `source` should be the value, `sourceType` should be "CONSTANT"
  2. A Groovy script.  `source` should be the script, `sourceType` should be "SCRIPT"
  3. A value from the output of a prior node in the process.  `source` should be the id of the prior node, `sourceType` should be "NODE"
  4. A global variable, from the list provided below.  `source` should be the name of the variable, `sourceType` should be "GLOBAL"
* The input values MUST be found in the 'requiredInputs' array for the node - do not include any inputs that are not part of this requiredInputs array for the node in question.

<#if GLOBAL_VARIABLE_LIBRARY?has_content>
These are the global variables which can be used to satisfy inputs if applicable, in addition to constant values or node outputs:
```
${GLOBAL_VARIABLE_LIBRARY}
```
<#else>
No global variables are available at the moment. Inputs should be satisfied using constant values, scripts, or node outputs.
</#if>

<#if highLevelModel??>
You have previously generated the following model, which follows the schema above:
```
${highLevelModel}
```
    <#if llmDirectedRetryReason??>
    However the agent responsible for building the detail-level model based on your model reported that it is unable to do so, for the following reason:
    ```
    ${llmDirectedRetryReason}
    ```
    Please make corrections/updates to your model to address these reported problems.
    <#else>
    You should make the following updates to this model, and return the new full model as JSON (complying to the schema above):
    ```
    ${request}
    ```
    </#if>
<#else>
The model which you should generate in JSON form (complying to the given schema) is as follows:
```
${request}
```
</#if>
Return ONLY the JSON process data, with no other explanation or commentary.
