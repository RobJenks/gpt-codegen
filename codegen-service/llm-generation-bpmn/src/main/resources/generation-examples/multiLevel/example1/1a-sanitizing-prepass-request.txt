You are designing a business process model following the BPMN 2.0 standard.  You will be given a prompt which may contain the following issues:
* Spelling or grammar mistakes
* Non-idiomatic English
* Poorly-structured sentences or paragraphs

We therefore want to clean up this prompt before we begin generating a process model.  Please identify any of the above issues in the given prompt and correct them, then return the full corrected prompt.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT return any other content, commentary or formatting (e.g. backticks around the response).  Only return the updated prompt.

The prompt you should improve (where necessary) is as follows:
```
Create a detaled invoice processoring process, incl both manual and systematic and manual steps,  Include decision points and branches as necccesary
```
