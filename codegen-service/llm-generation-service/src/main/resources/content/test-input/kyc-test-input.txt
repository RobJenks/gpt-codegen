Create the following process:
Step 1: User Registration - User registers in the bank's system, providing basic information and creating an account.

Step 2: Data Collection - System prompts the user to enter personal information, such as name, address, contact details, and identification documents.

Step 3: Document Verification - User uploads identification documents (e.g., passport, driver's license), which are processed by an automated document verification system for authenticity and validity.

Step 4: Risk Assessment - System assesses the user's risk profile based on the provided information, analyzing factors like financial history, occupation, and purpose of the account.

Step 5: Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) - If the risk assessment triggers a need for EDD, system requests additional information and documentation from the user to fulfill regulatory requirements.

Step 6: Sanctions Screening - User's information is checked against international watchlists and sanction databases to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

Step 7: Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) Screening - User's status as a politically exposed person is checked against relevant databases to identify potential risks.

Step 8: Negative News Screening - User's name is screened against news sources and public records for any negative associations or adverse media coverage.

Step 9: Decision Making - System analyzes all the collected data, screening results, and risk assessments to determine whether to approve, reject, or escalate the onboarding process.

Branch to Step 5 (EDD): If additional information is required, the system generates a notification and requests the user to submit the requested documents manually.

Branch to Step 9 (Decision Making): If the system identifies potential red flags or discrepancies, it may flag the user's profile for manual review by a compliance officer.

Step 10: Approval/Rejection - System notifies the user of the onboarding decision, either approving the account opening or providing reasons for rejection.

Step 11: Account Activation - Upon approval, the system triggers the account activation process, generating account details and necessary documentation.

Step 12: User Notification - System notifies the user of successful account activation, providing account details, terms and conditions, and other relevant information.

Step 13: Ongoing Monitoring - User's account activity is monitored periodically to identify any suspicious transactions or changes in risk profile, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
